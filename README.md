# spec-extended

A library that provides spec extended versions of clojure's conditional and threading macros.
In all of the following examples `clojure.spec` has been impoted as `s`, while `spec-extended.core` has been imported as `se`.

## Example

```clojure
(s/def ::gt-than-fifty #(> % 50))

(se/when-let (s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty) [x (rand-int 100)]
  (println "valid value was" x))
```

## Properties

Lets assume that we have defined some spec, say:
```clojure
(s/def ::my-even even?)
```
The call `(s/valid? ::my-even 0)` will return `true` while `(s/valid? ::my-even 1)` will return `false`.
If however we try the following `(s/valid? ::my-even nil)` we are greeted with the following:
```clojure
IllegalArgumentException Argument must be an integer:   clojure.core/even? (core.clj:1383)
```
This begs the question... Should we provide a *stricter* spec? Perhaps something like:
```clojure
(s/def ::my-stricter-even (s/and number? even?)) ;;note the importance of order
```
Should we *relax* the notion of validity (i.e don't throw an exception)?
```clojure
(defmacro catch-errors-valid?
  [spec expr]
  `(try (s/valid? ~spec ~expr)
        (catch Exception e# nil)))
```
Or, was this the *correct* response?

All three approaches have their benefits and their drawbacks. If our specs are **pure** then catching exceptions is of no real consequence, an error thrown during validation is most likely type based or structural. However, if our spec uses some form of state, it would probably be wise to expose the error. Indeed, in some cirsumstances it would be very nice to know when our system is and is not acting as expected.

For this reason, `spec-extended` aims to provide three versions of each macro form.
- A version that hides validation exceptions. An exception thrown during validation is treated in the same way as `(not (s/valid? <expr>))`.
- A version with a single `!` suffix that exposes validation exceptions.
- A version with a double `!!` suffix that exposes validation exceptions and throws an exception when some entity does not conform to a spec.

### `if-let` and `when-let`
The most trivial and possibly most useful macro is the spec extended `if-let` form.

```clojure
(s/def ::gt-than-fifty #(> % 50))

(se/if-let (s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty) [x (rand-int 100)]
  (println "valid value was" x)
  (println "the else branch"))
```
In the above example `(rand-int 100)` is computed, and if the resulting value is `spec/valid?` with respect to the composed spec `(s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty)` the *then* branch is executed. In a similar fashion there is a `when-let`.
```clojure
(se/when-let (s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty) [x (rand-int 100)]
  (println "valid value was" x))

As mentioned in the Properties section, there are `if-let!` and `if-let!!` variants

```clojure
;; this will throw an error due to (even? nil)
(se/if-let! even? [x nil]
  (println "valid value was" x)
  (println "the else branch"))

;; this will throw an error due to (even? 1) being false
(se/if-let!! even? [x 1]
  (println "valid value was" x)
  (println "the else branch"))
```

### `some->` and `some->>`
The standard `some->` and `some->>` threading macros uses *nil punning* - it is assumed that if any form returns `nil` then no more forms should be evaluated.

The **spec extended** version of these macros takes the form:

```clojure
(some-> <expr>
        <spec> <form>
        <spec> <form>
        ...
        <spec> <form>)
```
Each `<spec>` is treated as a pre condition for each `<form>`. As soon as a `<spec>` is not `s/valid?` the value `nil` is returned (even if the next spec is `nil?`). One important aspect is that as testing a spec can result in an error being thrown, `spec-extended` treats any exceptions thrown in the validation process as **invalid**. If an exception is thrown while evaluating a `<form>` then the error will be thrown.

```clojure
(se/some-> 0
           even? inc
           odd?  inc)
```

### `as->`

```clojure
(ns my-project
  (:require [clojure.spec :as s]
            [spec-extended.core :as se]))

(s/def ::my-even even?)

(se/as-> 100 $
         (s/and number? ::my-even) (+ $ 50)
	 even? (do (println "hello from spec-extentions") $)
	 odd? (println "this will never execute"))
```
