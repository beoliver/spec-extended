# spec-extensions

A library that extends `clojure.spec`

Aims to provide spec extended versions of clojures branching and threading macros.

In all of the following examples `spec` has been impoted as `s`, while `spec-extended` has been imported as `se`.

### `if-let` and `when-let`
The most trivial and possibly most useful macro is the spec extended `if-let` form.

```clojure
(s/def ::gt-than-fifty #(> % 50))

(se/if-let (s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty) [x (rand-int 100)]
  (println "valid value was" x)
  (println "the else branch"))
```
In the above example `(rand-int 100)` is computed, and if the resulting value is `spec/valid?` with respect to the composed spec `(s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty)` the *then* branch is executed. In a similar fashion there is a `when-let`.
```clojure
(se/when-let (s/and even? ::gt-than-fifty) [x (rand-int 100)]
  (println "valid value was" x))
```
### `some->` and `some->>`
The standard `some->` and `some->>` threading macros uses *nil punning* - it is assumed that if any form returns `nil` then no more forms should be evaluated.

The **spec extended** version of these macros takes the form:

```clojure
(some-> <expr>
        <spec> <form>
        <spec> <form>
        ...
        <spec> <form>)
```
Each `<spec>` is treated as a pre condition for each `<form>`. As soon as a `<spec>` is not `s/valid?` the value `nil` is returned (even if the next spec is `nil?`). One important aspect is that as testing a spec can result in an error being thrown, `spec-extended` treats any exceptions thrown in the validation process as **invalid**. If an exception is thrown while evaluating a `<form>` then the error will be thrown.

```clojure
(se/some-> 0
           even? inc
           odd?  inc)
```

### `as->`

```clojure
(ns my-project
  (:require [clojure.spec :as s]
            [spec-extensions.core :as se]))

(s/def ::my-even even?)

(se/as-> 100 $
         (s/and number? ::my-even) (+ $ 50)
	 even? (do (println "hello from spec-extentions") $)
	 odd? (println "this will never execute"))
```
